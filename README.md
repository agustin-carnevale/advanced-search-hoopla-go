# advanced-search-hoopla-go

**A Go-based CLI demonstrating advanced search techniques, RAG principles, and LLM-assisted scoring pipelines.**

This CLI experiment showcases how to combine _multiple search strategies_, normalize and weight results, and integrate retrieval-augmented logic with language models. Although it's still a work-in-progress, it already includes meaningful implementations that demonstrate advanced search and ranking behaviors.
